    "# Example 1: Softmax scores\n",
    "Softmax-based methods are among the most widely used techniques for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, leveraging the probabilistic outputs of a model to differentiate between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. These methods are inherently tied to models employing a softmax activation function in their final layer, such as logistic regression or neural networks with a classification output layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The softmax function normalizes the logits (i.e., sum of neuron input without passing through activation function) in the final layer, squeezing the output into a range between 0 and 1. This is useful for interpreting the modelâ€™s predictions as probabilities. Softmax probabilities are computed as:  \n",

    "In this lesson, we will train a logistic regression model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset and explore how its softmax outputs can signal whether a given input belongs to the ID classes (e.g., T-shirts or pants) or is OOD (e.g., sandals). While softmax is most naturally applied in models with a logistic activation, alternative approaches, such as applying softmax-like operations post hoc to models with different architectures, are occasionally used. However, these alternatives are less common and may require additional considerations. By focusing on logistic regression, we aim to illustrate the fundamental principles of softmax-based OOD detection in a simple and interpretable context before extending these ideas to more complex architectures."

It assumes that the directions of maximum variance in the data can be captured by linear combinations of the original features. This can be a limitation when the data has complex, non-linear relationships, as PCA may not capture the true structure of the data. However, if you're using a linear model (as we are here), PCA can be more appropriate for visualizing in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data because both PCA and linear models operate under linear assumptions. PCA will effectively capture the main variance in the data as seen by the linear model, making it easier to understand the decision boundaries and how OOD data deviates from the ID data within those boundaries."
