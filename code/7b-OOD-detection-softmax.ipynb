    "# Example 1: Softmax scores\n",
    "Softmax-based methods are among the most widely used techniques for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, leveraging the probabilistic outputs of a model to differentiate between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. These methods are inherently tied to models employing a softmax activation function in their final layer, such as logistic regression or neural networks with a classification output layer. Softmax produces a normalized probability distribution across the classes, which can then be thresholded to identify OOD instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will train a logistic regression model to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset and explore how its softmax outputs can signal whether a given input belongs to the ID classes (e.g., T-shirts or pants) or is OOD (e.g., sandals). While softmax is most naturally applied in models with a logistic activation, alternative approaches, such as applying softmax-like operations post hoc to models with different architectures, are occasionally used. However, these alternatives are less common and may require additional considerations, such as recalibrating the output scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on logistic regression, we aim to illustrate the fundamental principles of softmax-based OOD detection in a simple and interpretable context before extending these ideas to more complex architectures."

    "**Focus on Linear Relationships**: PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique. It assumes that the directions of maximum variance in the data can be captured by linear combinations of the original features. This can be a limitation when the data has complex, non-linear relationships, as PCA may not capture the true structure of the data. However, if you're using a linear model (as we are here), PCA can be more appropriate for visualizing in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data because both PCA and linear models operate under linear assumptions. PCA will effectively capture the main variance in the data as seen by the linear model, making it easier to understand the decision boundaries and how OOD data deviates from the ID data within those boundaries."

    "\n",
    "In practice, selecting an appropriate threshold is an iterative process that balances the trade-off between correctly identifying in-distribution (ID) data and accurately flagging out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Here's how you can iteratively determine the threshold:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Define Evaluation Metrics**: While confusion matrices are an excellent tool when you're ready to more closely examine the data, we need a single metric that can summarize threshold performance so we can easily compare across threshold. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, or the F1 score for both ID and OOD detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Evaluate Over a Range of Thresholds**: Test different threshold values and evaluate the performance on a validation set containing both ID and OOD data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Select the Optimal Threshold**: Choose the threshold that provides the best balance according to your chosen metrics.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Micro-Averaging: Aggregates the contributions of all classes to compute the average F1 score. This is typically used for imbalanced datasets as it gives more weight to classes with more instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weighted-Averaging: Calculates the F1 score for each class independently and then takes the average, weighted by the number of true instances for each class. This accounts for class imbalance by giving more weight to classes with more instances.\n",
