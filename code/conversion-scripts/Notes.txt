.md -> Notebook


METHOD1: Jupytext. This gives a quick result, but fails to separate code and markdown cells. See METHOD2a/METHOD2b for best.

1) I used jupytext for this. After materials become stable enough on git, run :

jupytext --to notebook "notebook.md"

2) To convert all md files in folder, use:

for file in *.md; do jupytext --to notebook "$file"; done # bash / git bash

FOR %f IN (*.md) DO jupytext --to notebook "%f" # anaconda prompt / windows




METHOD2a: Use custom script found in code/conversion-scripts. This works well for converting single files.

(base) C:\Users\Endemann\Documents\GitHub\fair-explainable-ml\code\conversion-scripts>python convert-md-to-ipynb.py ../../episodes ../code https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-explainable-ml/raw/main/images 8-releasing-a-model.md

METHOD2b: To convert all md files (except those excluded explicitly in batch script), run the following:

(base) C:\Users\Endemann\Documents\GitHub\fair-explainable-ml\code\conversion-scripts>python batch_convert_md_to_ipynb.py
