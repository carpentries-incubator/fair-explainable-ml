.md -> Notebook


METHOD1: Jupytext. This gives a quick result, but fails to separate code and markdown cells.

1) I used jupytext for this. After materials become stable enough on git, run :

jupytext --to notebook "notebook.md"



2) To convert all md files in folder, use:

for file in *.md; do jupytext --to notebook "$file"; done # bash / git bash

FOR %f IN (*.md) DO jupytext --to notebook "%f" # anaconda prompt / windows
