The disparate impact score will be between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates *no bias* and 0 indicates extreme bias. In other words, we want a score that is close to 1, because this indicates that different demographic groups have similar outcomes under the model.

Choosing a slightly smaller threshold, e.g., around 0.15, yields similarly high-accuracy and is slightly fairer. However, there's no \"good\" outcome here: whenever the accuracy is near-optimal, the 1-DI score is high.
