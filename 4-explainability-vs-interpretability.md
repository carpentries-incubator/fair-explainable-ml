::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Showcase machine learning models that are widely used in practice.
- Understand and distinguish between explainable machine learning models and interpretable machine learning models.
- Describe two reasons when deciding which model to choose.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- **Model Explainability vs. Model Interpretability:**
   - **Interpretability:** Refers to the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision made by a model. It is essential for verifying the correctness of the model, ensuring compliance with regulations, and enabling effective debugging.
   - **Explainability:** Refers to the extent to which the internal mechanics of a machine learning model can be explained in human terms. It is crucial for understanding how models make decisions, ensuring transparency, and building trust with stakeholders.
   

- **Choosing Between Explainable and Interpretable Models:**
   - **When Transparency is Critical:** Opt for interpretable models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees) when it is essential to have a clear understanding of how decisions are made, such as in healthcare or finance.
   - **When Performance is a Priority:** Choose explainable models (e.g., neural networks, gradient boosting machines) when predictive accuracy is the primary concern, and you can use explanation methods to understand model behavior.
