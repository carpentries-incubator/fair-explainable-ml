## Clone the git project
<!--
## Data Sets
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link. Download the [data zip file](https://example.com/FIXME) and unzip it to your Desktop
-->

There are a number of files we need to conduct the workshop. By cloning the git repository, you will be able to have a copy of all of the necessary files and functions required to run through the exercises.

1. Click the link below to open the [Github](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/fair-explainable-ml/tree/main) page.
2. Click the green "Code <>" button.
3. Click "Download as zip."
4. Unzip the directory to your desktop or working directory.

## Create a Hugging Face account and access Token
You will need a Hugging Face account for the workshop episode on model sharing. Hugging Face is a very popular machine learning (ML) platform and community that helps users build, deploy, share, and train machine learning models. 

**Create account**: To create an account on Hugging Face, visit: [huggingface.co/join](https://huggingface.co/join). Enter an email address and password, and follow the instructions provided via Hugging Face (you may need to verify your email address) to complete the process.

**Setup access token**: Once you have your account created, you’ll need to generate an access token so that you can upload/share models to your Hugging Face account during the workshop. To generate a token, visit the [Access Tokens setting page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) after logging in. Once there, click “New token” to generate an access token. We’ll use this token later to log in to Hugging Face via Python

## Software setup

### Installing Python using Anaconda

[Python][python] is a popular language for scientific computing, and a frequent choice
for machine learning as well. Installing all of its scientific packages
individually can be a bit difficult, however, so we recommend the installer [Anaconda][anaconda]
which includes most (but not all) of the software you will need.

Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you install Python
version 3.x (e.g., 3.4 is fine). Also, please set up your python environment at
least a day in advance of the workshop.  If you encounter problems with the
installation procedure, ask your workshop organizers via e-mail for assistance so
you are ready to go as soon as the workshop begins.

### Windows

Checkout the [video tutorial][video-windows] or:

1. Open [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution][anaconda-distribution]
with your web browser.
2. Download the Python 3 installer for Windows.
3. Double-click the executable and install Python 3 using _MOST_ of the
   default settings. The only exception is to check the
   **Make Anaconda the default Python** option.

### MacOS

Checkout the [video tutorial][video-mac] or:

1. Open [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution][anaconda-distribution]
   with your web browser.
2. Download the Python 3 installer for OS X.
   Make sure to use the correct version for your hardware, 
   i.e. choose the options with "(M1)" if yours is one of the more recent models
   containing Apple's chip.
3. Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.

### Linux

Note that the following installation steps require you to work from the shell.
If you run into any difficulties, please request help before the workshop begins.

1.  Open [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution][anaconda-distribution] with your web browser.
2.  Download the Python 3 installer for Linux.
3.  Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation.
    a.  Open a terminal window.
    b.  Navigate to the folder where you downloaded the installer
    c.  Type
    ```bash
    bash Anaconda3-
    ```
    and press tab.  The name of the file you just downloaded should appear.
    d.  Press enter.
    e.  Follow the text-only prompts.  When the license agreement appears (a colon
        will be present at the bottom of the screen) hold the down arrow until the
        bottom of the text. Type `yes` and press enter to approve the license. Press
        enter again to approve the default location for the files. Type `yes` and
        press enter to prepend Anaconda to your `PATH` (this makes the Anaconda
        distribution the default Python).

### Installing the required packages

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) is the package management system associated with [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Conda should already be available in your system once you installed Anaconda successfully. Conda thus works regardless of the operating system.

1. Make sure you have an up-to-date version of Conda running.
   See [these instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/update-version/) for updating Conda if required.

2. Create the Conda Environment: To create a conda environment called `trustworthy_ML` with the required packages, open a terminal (Mac/Linux) or Anaconda prompt (Windows) and type the below command. This command creates a new conda environment named `trustworthy_ML` and installs the necessary packages from the `conda-forge` and `pytorch` channels. When prompted to Proceed ([y]/n) during environment setup, press y. It may take around 10-20 minutes to complete the full environment setup. Please reach out to the workshop organizers sooner rather than later to fix setup issues prior to the workshop. 
   
    ```sh
    conda create --name trustworthy_ML python=3.9 jupyter scikit-learn pandas umap-learn pytorch torchvision torchaudio -c conda-forge -c pytorch
    ```

3. Activate the Conda Environment: After creating the environment, activate it using the following command.
   
    ```sh
    conda activate trustworthy_ML
    ```

4. Install `pytorch-ood` Package: Install the `pytorch-ood` package using `pip` since it may not be available through conda.
   
    ```sh
    pip install pytorch-ood
    ```


### Notes:
- conda-forge Channel: The `conda-forge` is a community-driven conda channel that provides a wide array of up-to-date packages, ensuring better compatibility and a more extensive package library.

### Starting Jupyter Lab

We will teach using Python in [Jupyter lab][jupyter], a
programming environment that runs in a web browser. Jupyter requires a reasonably
up-to-date browser, preferably a current version of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox
(note that Internet Explorer version 9 and below are *not* supported). If you
installed Python using Anaconda, Jupyter should already be on your system. If
you did not use Anaconda, use the Python package manager pip
(see the [Jupyter website][jupyter-install] for details.)

To start jupyter lab, open a terminal (Mac/Linux) or Anaconda prompt (Windows) and type the command:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

### Check your software setup
To check whether all packages installed correctly, start a jupyter notebook in jupyter lab as
explained above. Run the following lines of code:
```python
import sklearn
print('sklearn version: ', sklearn.__version__)

import pandas
print('pandas version: ', pandas.__version__)

import torch
print('torch version: ', torch.__version__)
```

This should output the versions of all required packages without giving errors.
Most versions will work fine with this lesson, but:
- For pytorch, the minimum version is 2.0
- For sklearn, the minimum version is 1.2.2

### Fallback option: cloud environment
If a local installation does not work for you, it is also possible to run this lesson in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Some packages may need to be installed on the fly within the notebook (TBD).
