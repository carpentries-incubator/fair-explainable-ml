:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- For what prediction tasks is machine learning an appropriate tool?
- How can inappropriate target variable choice lead to suboptimal outcomes in a machine learning pipeline?
- What is "biased" training data, and where does this bias come from?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Judge what tasks are appropriate for machine learning
- Understand why the choice of prediction task / target variable is important.
- Describe how bias can appear in training data.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Some tasks are not appropriate for machine learning due to ethical concerns. 
- Machine learning tasks should have a valid prediction target that maps clearly to the real-world goal.
- Training data can be biased due to societal inequities, errors in the data collection process, and lack of attention to careful sampling practices.
